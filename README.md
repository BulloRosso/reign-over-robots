# Well-architected framework for AI agents

This project covers the automated creation and maintenance of AI agents based upon the OpenAI APIs - esp. assistants API v2.

The plan is to grow documentation together with code in a 50%/50% ratio: Only if the textual description is precise and complete next generation LLMs will be able to modify the existing codebase with high precision.

# Prerequisites
An API key for OpenAI with unrestricted permissions. This is required because the Python code will create objects like assistants and files.

# Deployment scopes
Agents developed with this framework can be used either stand-alone or deployed into the Azure cloud.

# Status
Experimental

# License
