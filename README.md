# Well-architected framework for AI agents

This project covers the automated creation and maintenance of AI agents based upon the OpenAI APIs.

The plan is to grow documentation together with code in a 50%/50% ratio: Only if the textual description is precise and complete next generation LLMs will be able to modify the existing codebase with high precision.

# Deployment scopes
Agents developed with this framework can be used either stand-alone or deployed into the Azure cloud.

# Status
Experimental
